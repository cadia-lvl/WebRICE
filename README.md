# WebRICE
WebRICE (Web Reader ICE) is an open source web reader in development at
Reykjavik University. We hope that Icelandic developers will add this free
software to their websites to enable Icelandic audiences to listen to the web
instead of reading it.

## Installation
1.  Install packages with: `npm install`
2.  Run with: `npm run dev`

## Usage
TODO: write usage when we have an npm package and plugins

A demo of WebRICE can be found [here](https://cadia-lvl.github.io/WebRICE/) once this repo is public.
